For a simple, lean MVP (a minimal viable product that still sings the Ackee spirit), it might be a matter of 6 to 8 weeks. But if you’re aiming for a robust, feature-packed app designed to grow and evolve over time – one that’s built to last, not just a one-off delivery to be forgotten in a drawer – it’s more realistic to expect anywhere from 3 to 6 months. \n\nOf course, every project is its own adventure. We work hand in hand with our clients, iterating on design, functionality, testing and a bit of magic (and yes, plenty of coding) to ensure that what we deliver isn’t just a mobile app, but a sustainable digital product that truly makes a difference. \n\nSo, if you’re dreaming of that next-level mobile app, I’m here to talk about Ackee and how we turn big ideas into digital realities—step by careful, creative step."}]}
